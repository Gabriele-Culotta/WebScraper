# WebScraper
Small project using js, node js , express js and two npm packages:
- Axios
- Cheerio (a very interesting npm library that allows you to take from html the classes and attributes, in my case are "url, text").
Thanks to these packages I was able to create a web scraping that allows me to quickly find the most important data of a web page.
